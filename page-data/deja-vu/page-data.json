The same scene in front of my eyes. The same music playing in my head.\nThe ambience. The visceral feeling.\nLike I’ve been ushered back in time to do something differently.\nTo observe what I didn’t before. Maybe change someone’s fate.\n‘Come on, change the perspective. React differently. Think. Now…’</p>\n<p>But before I get back to my senses,I see that I’ve lost it.\nThe fleeting Invincibility I felt is gone in a snap.\nBut the impact of the revelation hasn’t weathered away yet. I can still feel the adrenaline induced organs crying out loud in ecstasy. Begging me to act.\nBut my mind’s numb. Still in shock. I had one simple chance, and I ruined it.\nChange the timeline, huh? More like a Sphere.\nDeja vu,I guess.\nTime loops repeatedly till you do what you’re destined to. Make the right choice.\nPush forward.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Deja Vu","date":"Sep13, 2019","subtitle":"It's all happened already.","background":"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/096/914/large/sandra-knego-monotonous-and-confused.jpg","background_artist":"https://www.artstation.com/sandraknego","category":"poetry"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/deja-vu/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/box-of-issues/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Box of Issues"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-pledge-for-truth/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A pledge for truth."}}}}}
