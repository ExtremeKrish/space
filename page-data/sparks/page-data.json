It was bad; I wasted a full day on addictions and autopilot.\nI caved in and yielded to the withdrawal. I realised what was happening, and yet chose to let go of control.\nI feel bad for that, and I think I’m better than that.\nThat being said, <em>the good news:</em>\nThe past few days have been excellent! Not any normal good, but excellent!\nI have been extremely productive, like never before, atleast the past few years.</p>\n<h1>On top of things</h1>\n<p>My mind was racing, I was on top of things, and I had full control. No autopilot.\nI resisted urges, I showed restraint, and I fought demons.\nLooking back, it feels great that I was able to do that.\nIn fact, it gives me a kick thinking about that, and I cannot wait to do it all over again,\nthis time with a stronger punch. I was talking about trying to rekindle some of the fire I once had.\nI think I did just that.\nI got a load of things done, and not just that.\nI wasn’t trying to do stuff to pass the days, but rather I was the maker of the plans,\nand I was the executer. I had the big picture in mind, and I followed through with the actual work needed.\nWork was great, learning was great, and I even started a little side project!\nI think I can get addicted to being a strategist and an executioner; it’s sweet.\nThe past 3-4 days have given me immense hope and strength to do this right.</p>\n<h1>Looking ahead</h1>\n<p>It sucks that I relapsed by day 5, but this has taught me so much!\nThis time, I’m gonna go against the dragon with knowledge of the past, and a lot more fortitude, and perseverance.\nI cannot wait to kickstart this again, and be awesome at it.\nI cannot stop thinking about success, and the future.\nI cannot wait to persist, execute strats, innovate, excel and disrupt.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sparks","date":"Oct23, 2020","subtitle":"The beginning of the beginning","background":"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/021/272/964/large/brian-c-hailes-dgntcp-illo-5-finish-1280.jpg","background_artist":"https://www.artstation.com/bchailes","category":"blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/sparks/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/torpor/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Torpor"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/colour-photo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Colour Photo (2020) [Spoilers]"}}}}}
