No one had spotted them yet. They knew it because they weren’t dead yet. It was a suicide mission; even one mistake could cost them their lives and also alter the fate of their state, forever.\nThey could see the sun setting on the Horizon as they rode their bikes on the desert. That meant that they had very little time to infiltrate the market, which was now sprawling with X’s army. They couldn’t afford to be spotted either by the civilians or X’s henchmen. They left the keys with the dirt bikes, should there be any need for a quick getaway.\nSo here they were, at the last tent, beside which were two uninteresting civilians ranting about their favorite movies.\n‘Easy-teasy.’\n‘Which one do you want?’\n‘Left.’\n‘Okay, on my count…1, 2,WAIT !’\nM walked up to one of them and quickly slit his throat. Blood squirted from his neck as J slid in and killed the other.\n‘You were saying something?’\n‘Disguises. Nevermind.’ said J, snatching two scarves from the adjoining stall.\nNo amount of acting could obscure even the most inconspicuous of enemies from J and M. It was the ‘nervous toes’ that blew their disguise this time. ‘Jeez, they can’t even act’, M would say.\nThey quickly dressed up with the guards’ clothes, and covered the blood on the shirts with the scarves.\n‘We’ll do our thing, or the protocol?’\n‘Our thing. It’s too risky to leave them alive if we’re spotted.’\nThey had their silenced pistols locked and loaded. Their mission was clear: Get to X, capture him, and extract him back to the state. Their mission was also impossible: There were about a hundred soldiers between them and X, it was getting dark, which meant spotting them would be more difficult, and they had the feeling that it was all a trap. But it was J and M. They could do it.</p>\n<p>“Comment ca va?”\n“Ca va tres bien, merci.”\n“Quand allons nous a la maison?”\n“bientot.”\n“non. maintenant!”\nJ’s bullet ended up in the unsuspecting guard’s skull as M quickly grabbed him and dragged him into the alley. The French photographers could not be of any harm, right? That’s what the dead people thought. J had this theory that ‘the more people play the part under cover, the more difficult it gets for someone to tell if they’re all spies. It just feels too ridiculous, implausible.’ There was a time when J, M and 8 of their friends all acted as tourists, got into the enemy colony with cameras, took photos with them, had dinner, and then shot them all. Sly bastards. They could speak a heck load of languages, had 7 different hand writing styles, 10 different walking styles, 20 different personalities. And new characters would be born every new adventure. This time it was the French photographers’ turn.\nThey would keep talking, J would take out the camera, tag the guards to M’s glasses, M would either stab them or shoot them, J would quickly drag him into the alleys, and they’d get on with clicking photos again, changing turns. Rinse and repeat. They had ‘mastered the art’ in 10 minutes, and with each passing block, 10 bullets were fired, 10 bodies piled up in the alleys, 10 personalities talked, and not one civilian there had any sort of idea that this was happening.\nThey knew they were now close to the tent X was hiding in. It was only a matter of time before X would be extracted out of the country by these men, and they were there to stop that.\n‘This is it. That’s him in there.’\nAs always, they threw the Nik’s Toy first. The Nik’s toy was a self inflating human shaped balloon which could fit in a hand. They’d throw it in first, it would inflate abruptly making a loud noise, the hostiles would shoot it in a frenzy, and then J and M would enter the place from opposite directions and shoot ‘em up. It was the perfect bait.\nBut it didn’t work this time. No one shot Nik’s toy.\n‘Something’s wrong… Damn it, He’s not inside.’\nJ scanned the place and found a pickup truck leaving the place at the far right. Zooming in on it, all they could see was X flipping them off through the rearview mirror.\nThey dashed towards the exit frantically as sirens started howling and choppers began circling the market. The civilians were terrified and started screaming and running in all directions.\n‘I knew this wasn’t going to be this easy.’\n‘X is playing us. And I have a feeling we’re falling for it again.’ M said in a restless tone.\n‘But we got no choice. Let’s play his game.’ J grabbed his bike, and the engine roared as he switched it to Turbo mode. M got on the back, and the two set off behind the pick up truck as the choppers followed them.\n-----DUST-----\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Spy game - Dust","date":"Oct24, 2016","subtitle":"Infiltration","background":"https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/024/286/363/4k/anita-mohacsi-anita-keyframe-5.jpg","background_artist":"https://www.artstation.com/chibilade","category":"fiction"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/spy-game-dust/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lightning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lightning"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/spy-game-dawn/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spy game - Dawn"}}}}}
