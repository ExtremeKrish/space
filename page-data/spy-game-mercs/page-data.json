Me nik mag etc. We sneak into a giant complex a party is being hosted, we need to take out a vip. He’s in his room, there’s cctvs everywhere.\nWe sneak into his floor, get in his suite and take care after some talk. Great view from his suite. However as soon as we exit his room the alarms ring. Someone got into the cctv room.\nWe make a dash in diff directions. I get to the emergency stairs, get near the basement exit and see a homeless guy smoking crack. I hear footsteps and hide next to the lift, I see 10-15 swat guys proceeding through the same stairs upwards. How is swat already here? I know I’ve worn balaclavas near  cameras so my outfit is the only giveaway. I find clothes wear them and burn mine in the homeless guy’s trash. I get out into the compound and blend with the guests.\nMag and nik made it out too…\n.\nWe’re in the usa. We just got into the house of the guy giving us our next assignment. He’s a creep, has a family but other ladies right in the next house. The whole building is his. We’re staying there till the time is right to begin his assignment. Guy is fkin weird, “pretty sure he’ll blow up soon” “I concur”\n…\nWe’re made. Nik and Mag are awol. I creep around the neighborhood as swat is sweeping the area. I hold off until the night, I see a stealth chopper arriving. I dive into the lake and they rope me in. I quickly change into a soldiers outfit as they brief me that the mission was a bust. I’m actually on my way to Mexico. We follow a river along the jungle. I’m rappelled out into a group of 10 soldiers who are about to attack an outpost. They’ve been briefed to expect a specialist joining them but he’s been taken care of and Ive taken his place. I speak their language and they’ve no idea. We’re making our way to the outpost as I switch my night vision on. My Misson is to take care of another hvt hwos visiting the outpost. “serendipity” was the word the pilot used. I’m gonna take his possessions and live in his mansion till I get the brief on the next mission. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Spy game - Mercs","date":"Aug22, 2021","subtitle":"A thousand lives","background":"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/325/512/large/daniel-sia-doomcan.jpg","background_artist":"https://www.artstation.com/sia","category":"blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/spy-game-mercs/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-blog-regularly/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to blog regularly"}},"next":null}}}
