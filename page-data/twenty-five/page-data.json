Was it really me? I was so lost back then; if only I had known better.\nBut the idea remains, I want to do something, I want to disrupt stuff. I still have the verve, maybe more than ever. I just lack the discipline to follow it through.\nMaybe all in good time.\nAs Yuv said, you get closer every attempt, even if you fail. That is so profound; the key is to never stop and come at it stronger each turn. Kinda like that monster from Betrayal at house on the haunted hill.\nMaybe I won’t cower the next time I’m faced with a challenge, and actually take it in the face instead of turning my back. I can see clearly in hindsight how easy all the things I learnt are, and how they appeared like mammoths when I step foot in. Just need to maintain the 20/20 experience.\nDistraction is another key; monkey see, monkey no do.\nAghhhh how perspectives change in a matter of years.\nThis is my chance to push forward and not look back.\nFeels great thinking about it.\nLet’s disrupt. I like that word. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Twenty Five","date":"Jun27, 2020","subtitle":null,"background":null,"background_artist":null,"category":"blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/twenty-five/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-upward-spiral/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Upward Spiral"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/feelings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Feelings"}}}}}
