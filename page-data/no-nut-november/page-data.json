We will get out of this.\nAlso thinking about the implications of victory here. Just a month ago, I could not amount to anything.\nBut there we will be, scoffing at the past self, full of confidence and an unwavering presence, mentally and physically. We will conqueror this, and we will accomplish much much greater things.</p>\n<p><em>Nov 1st, 2AM</em>\nWe will be unimpeachable, no excuses allowed.\nFortitude and tenacity are the name of the game.\nThis is not just about no nut, but also getting into order, and out of autopilot.\nSo, I need a routine as well.\nI will put up sticky notes for everything that can be done. I have already finalized what goes on the stickies.\nI have made the rules, guidelines and fallback that you see below, to be clear about everything before taking the dive.\nLet’s do this right.\nPOWER TO US. </p>\n<h1>Road to nnn</h1>\n<p>It’s that time; I was never the one to do this kinda thing, but here we are in dire straits.\nLet’s actually do this and push our limits.\nThis will be one giant post with updates along the way. Let’s make a huge deal out of this. </p>\n<h1>Rules of nnn</h1>\n<p>No nut,\nno stuff,\n30 days of power.</p>\n<h1>Guides</h1>\n<p>Always keep room unlocked. Don’t bolt yourself in.\nDon’t let autopilot take over. Take a break and go out of the room for a while if you are feeling lazy. Autopilot is insidious.\nAvoid stumbling onto harmful material on the tv/computer. Just walk away/switch off if it’s already late, and just don’t think about it.\nDon’t stay up late without purpose.\nConstant documentation &#x26; communication with fellow nnners is great. It will motivate you and strengthen your conviction. Go a step further and tell them how you conquered your urges; you will feel great, and their will bolstered.\nDo periodic refreshers, where you ‘start over’ from that day, so you won’t feel like it has gone on for too long. In short, split it up into steps, probably a week at a go. </p>\n<h1>Fallback</h1>\n<p>Wash your face with cold water, run out of the room and go for a walk (run if it is too bad). If you are feeling too weak, make a vlog out of it and describe what you are going through.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"No Nut November","date":"Nov07, 2020","subtitle":"Pushing the Limits","background":"https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/018/257/366/large/tanner-staheli-dojo.jpg","background_artist":"https://www.artstation.com/tannerstaheli","category":"blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/no-nut-november/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/colour-photo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Colour Photo (2020) [Spoilers]"}},"next":null}}}
